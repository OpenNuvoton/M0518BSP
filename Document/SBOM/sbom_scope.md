# Introduction

The MCU BSP SBOM package consists of two CycloneDX SBOM files: a Product SBOM and a Test Sample SBOM. The Product SBOM includes components that are included in, linked with, deployed to, or reasonably expected to be integrated into the final product firmware/software. The Test Sample SBOM includes components used only for examples, demonstrations, validation, or testing and not included in the product runtime unless explicitly integrated by the user.

# Product SBOM

Used for CRA compliance, product vulnerability management, and customer product integration risk assessment.

## Scope
Drivers, middleware, libraries, startup code, boot code, binaries, and source components that are compiled, linked, flashed, deployed, or reasonably expected to be integrated into the product by customers.

## Evidence
.
└── Library

CMSIS evidence used by the Product SBOM is limited to `Library/CMSIS/Include`. This directory contains 11 vendored ARM headers: CMSIS-Core 3.1.0 headers for Cortex-M/SecurCore and CMSIS-DSP 1.1.0 public headers. The CMSIS SBOM record does not assert that other CMSIS subareas or a complete upstream CMSIS package are present.

# Test Sample SBOM

Used for transparent disclosure and internal/customer evaluation, but labeled as non-product runtime dependency.

## Scope
sample code、demo project、host-side test tool、sample validation script、test harness、third-party tool for sample code.
